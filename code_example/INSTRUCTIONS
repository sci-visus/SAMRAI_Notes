Its easier to run this example on one of the LC machines like cab or sierra as
SAMRAI builds without any issues on those machines. Also, you should place the
contents of this folder within the MblkLinAdv and compile the code. 

Also note that this example is a hack at understanding the SAMRAI class
structure. 

The files mergeTreeWrapper.h and mergeTreeWrapper.cc are the files that enable
extraction of SAMRAI data.
